# Local Testing Walkthrough

The purpose of this walkthrough is to teach you how to use the kCTF infrastructure.

## Testing with just Docker

Following this walkthrough requires a local linux machine capable of running docker.

This is the fastest way to get started with developing of challenges. You can also [test with a local kubernetes cluster](#testing-with-kubernetes) for emulating the production environment more closely.

### Install docker
```
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
sudo sh get-docker.sh
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER && newgrp docker
```

### Download kCTF
```
sudo apt-get install -y subversion
svn checkout https://github.com/google/google-ctf/trunk/infrastructure/kctf
PATH=$PATH:$PWD/kctf/bin
```

### Create basic demo challenge
```
CHALDIR=$(mktemp -d)
kctf-setup-chal-dir $CHALDIR
kctf-chal-create test-1
```

### Test connecting to the challenge
This will take a bit longer the first time it is run, as it has to build a chroot.
```
cd $CHALDIR/test-1
make test-docker
sudo apt-get install -y netcat
nc 127.0.0.1 1337
```

If all went well, you should have a shell inside an nsjail bash, if you didn't, there might be some issues with your system (support for nsjail, docker, or else).

## Testing with Kubernetes

For testing challenges in the same environment as production, as well as to test challenges that require changes to the Kubernetes configuration, you can also test with a local Kubernetes cluster. This is the recommended method, although it takes a bit longer to setup, and is not available in Google Cloud Shell.

### Install a local Kubernetes cluster

There are several options for installing a local Kubernetes cluster.

1. **KIND** - [Follow instructions here](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/).
1. **Docker for Desktop** - Windows users can try the built-in Kubernetes cluster. See [WSL1 instructions here](#wsl1).

### Running the challenge in Kubernetes
Once you run the command to create the cluster (`kind create cluster`), you can try to run:
```
make test-kind
```

This will deploy the challenge and healthcheck in the local kubernetes cluster.

## Debug failures

The instructions below might help you resolve errors in the setup.

### Errors with docker

#### Errors installing docker

If you get this error installing docker in Ubuntu:
```
E: Package 'docker-ce' has no installation candidate
```
Try to install Ubuntu's version of docker:
```
sudo apt-get install -y docker.io
```

#### Permission denied on /var/run/docker.sock

If you get an error like this:
```
Got permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket at unix:///var/run/docker.sock: Post http://%2Fvar%2Frun%2Fdocker.sock/v1.40/build?buildargs=%7B%7D&cachefrom=%5B%5D&cgroupparent=&cpuperiod=0&cpuquota=0&cpusetcpus=&cpusetmems=&cpushares=0&dockerfile=Dockerfile&labels=%7B%7D&memory=0&memswap=0&networkmode=default&rm=1&session=&shmsize=0&t=kctf-nsjail&target=&ulimits=null&version=1: dial unix /var/run/docker.sock: connect: permission denied
```

Your user doesn't have permission to run docker, to fix this, run:
```
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER && newgrp docker
```

#### Docker daemon error
In some cases, docker leaves the socket on the FS, but it's no longer running. The error looks like this:
```
Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///var/run/docker.sock. Is the docker daemon running?
```

To fix this, just run:
```
sudo service docker restart
```

#### IPv4 forwarding error
In some cases, docker might fail to run because of network errors. Check if you have this error
```
 ---> [Warning] IPv4 forwarding is disabled. Networking will not work.
```
If so, then you have to enable ipv4 forwarding, by running:
```
echo net.ipv4.ip_forward=1 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
```
And since this probably made docker cache an invalid `apt-get update`, you will also have to run `docker system prune -a` before running the `kctf-chal-test-docker` command again.

### Errors connecting to the challenge
If you can't connect, type:
```
docker ps -a
```
In the table, look for the last ran container, and then run:
```
docker logs CONTAINER_NAME
```
replacing CONTAINER_NAME with the name of the last ran container.

That will output the logs of the last time the container ran.

#### CLONE error in nsjail

If the error is like this:
```
[E][2020-01-31T20:16:39+0000][1] bool subproc::runChild(nsjconf_t*, int, int, int)():459 nsjail tried to use the CLONE_NEWCGROUP clone flag, which is supported under kernel versions >= 4.6 only. Try disabling this flag: Operation not permitted
[E][2020-01-31T20:16:39+0000][1] bool subproc::runChild(nsjconf_t*, int, int, int)():464 clone(flags=CLONE_NEWNS|CLONE_NEWCGROUP|CLONE_NEWUTS|CLONE_NEWIPC|CLONE_NEWUSER|CLONE_NEWPID|CLONE_NEWNET|SIGCHLD) failed. You probably need root privileges if your system doesn't support CLONE_NEWUSER. Alternatively, you might want to recompile your kernel with support for namespaces or check the current value of the kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone sysctl: Operation not permitted
```
That probably means that unprivileged user namespaces are not enabled, you can fix this by running:
```
(echo 1 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/unprivileged_userns_clone) || (echo 'kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone=1' | sudo tee /etc/sysctl.d/00-local-userns.conf) 2>&1
sudo service procps restart
```
And then try connecting through netcat again.

### Errors in Windows Subsystem for Linux

#### WSL1

The only **supported** method (see below for unsupported options) for testing on WSL1 is through a local Kubernetes cluster, and this is only possible for users with a Pro/Edu/Enterprise version of Windows 10. This is because [Docker for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/) requires [Hyper-V support](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/about/).

You must download [Docker for Windows](https://download.docker.com/win/stable/Docker%20Desktop%20Installer.exe) (1GB in size). It already includes Kubernetes, but the cluster has to be manually started in the UI. Go to *Settings > Kubernetes* and click on *"Enable Kubernetes"*.

Open WSL 1 and type:
```
echo -e '#!/bin/bash\n$(basename $0).exe $@' | tee  $HOME/.local/bin/docker $HOME/.local/bin/kubectl
chmod +x $HOME/.local/bin/docker $HOME/.local/bin/kubectl
```

Make sure you are running the windows version of Docker and kubectl:
```
docker version --format {{.Client.Os}}
kubectl version --client -o yaml | grep platform
```
If the commands say linux, you must uninstall the local linux versions, and make sure `~/.local/bin` is in your PATH.

Testing using just docker isn't possible (for that you need to try the [WSL1 unsupported flow](#wsl1-unsupported-flow)), since docker for Windows doesn't have access to do the necessary bind mounts. So you need to run `scripts/challenge/test-k8s.sh` instead of test-docker.

##### WSL1 unsupported flow

You can try the **unsupported** option for running docker. Try to [follow this guide](https://medium.com/faun/docker-running-seamlessly-in-windows-subsystem-linux-6ef8412377aa).

This is the only option available for WSL1 users on Windows 10 Home (other than running a VirtualBox VM).

#### WSL2

WSL2 should work out of the box, but it requires the user to be enrolled in Windows Insider, which has extra data collection by Microsoft and more Windows updates. The setup of WSL2 takes a while and multiple restarts.

1. Register in [Windows Insider](https://insider.windows.com/en-us/register/)
1. [Upgrade WSL to version 2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/wsl2-install)

Alternatively, the instructions for running WSL1 also work for WSL2 users.

### Errors inside the challenge
If you see errors like these:
```
bash: cannot set terminal process group (-1): Inappropriate ioctl for device
bash: no job control in this shell
```

That's normal, just ignore it. You should still get a shell afterwards.
